\section{Summary}
% Summarise our efforts over the entire time period of SDP. What we were ableto achieve, what we failed in, and introduce the sections in the report.


\section{Organisation and Management}
The model adopted and put into parctice for our team was largely a tiered hierarchial structure with a single official team leader Roy, who was experienced and proficient in electronics and hardware matters, and a lead software developer Chris, as he was most experienced in programming and high level planning. The rest of the members were assigned supportive roles based on their skill and experience.
