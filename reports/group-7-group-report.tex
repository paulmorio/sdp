\section{Abstract}

\section{Organisation and Management}
The model adopted and put into parctice for our team was largely a tiered hierarchial structure with a single official team leader Roy, who was experienced and proficient in electronics and hardware matters, and a lead software developer Chris, as he was most experienced in programming and high level planning. The rest of the members were assigned supportive roles based on their skill and experience.
